<h1>Cloud Strife</h1>
<br>

<div class="justified-text">
    <p>Cloud Strife is one of the most deeply layered and enduring protagonists in video game history, serving as the emotional and narrative core of Final Fantasy VII. Introduced as a cold, confident ex-SOLDIER turned mercenary, Cloud initially presents himself as a detached professional aiding the eco-terrorist group AVALANCHE in their mission to stop the corrupt megacorporation Shinra from draining the planet’s life force, Mako. However, beneath his aloof demeanor lies a fractured psyche and a manufactured identity shaped by trauma, loss, and unresolved guilt. As the story unfolds, Cloud’s composed persona unravels, revealing that much of his memory and personality are a construct—an amalgam of his own suppressed self and the memories of his childhood friend Zack Fair, a true SOLDIER whose life and death profoundly impacted Cloud’s sense of worth and reality. This psychological complexity is mirrored in his ongoing struggle with Sephiroth, a fallen hero turned godlike antagonist who manipulates Cloud’s fragile identity and connection to the alien entity Jenova. Cloud’s descent into a mental breakdown and eventual reawakening as his true self marks one of the most compelling character arcs in the series, transforming him from a pawn of fate into a self-aware and self-empowered hero. His iconic appearance—spiky blond hair, piercing blue Mako-infused eyes, and the massive Buster Sword slung over his back—has become emblematic of the Final Fantasy brand. In combat, Cloud is a versatile powerhouse, wielding Limit Breaks like Omnislash, which reflect his explosive strength and emotional intensity. More than a simple hero’s journey, Cloud’s story is one of identity, healing, and the search for meaning in a world scarred by loss and corporate greed. His vulnerability, growth, and ultimate redemption elevate Final Fantasy VII from a dystopian epic to a deeply human tale, making Cloud not just a video game icon, but a symbol of resilience in the face of existential crisis.</p>
