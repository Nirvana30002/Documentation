                Final Fantasy XV is a sprawling epic that follows Noctis Lucis Caelum, heir to the throne of Lucis, a kingdom that guards the last remaining Crystal—a powerful artifact tied to the gods. Tasked with traveling to Altissia to marry his childhood friend Lunafreya Nox Fleuret—a political union meant to bring peace—Noctis sets out with his loyal companions: Gladiolus Amicitia, his protector; Ignis Scientia, his strategist and advisor; and Prompto Argentum, his upbeat childhood friend. Their camaraderie and banter ground the game in a sense of realism and warmth, even as their world is torn apart. While they are on the road, the Niflheim Empire betrays the peace treaty, invades Insomnia, and kills King Regis, stealing the Crystal and forcing Noctis and his friends into exile. With nowhere to return, Noctis must grow from a brooding prince into a responsible king, embarking on a long journey filled with heartbreak, betrayal, sacrifice, and revelations about the divine conflict shaping their world.

                As their journey unfolds, they encounter Astrals—godlike beings who can be summoned in battle once their trials are overcome—and they discover the truth behind the Starscourge, a dark plague that plunges the world into eternal night and transforms creatures into monstrous daemons. The source of this blight is linked to the Crystal, the Astrals, and the man who manipulates events from the shadows: Ardyn Izunia, Niflheim’s chancellor. Ardyn is revealed to be Ardyn Lucis Caelum, an ancient relative of Noctis who was once chosen to absorb the Starscourge to heal the world, but was rejected by the gods and cursed with immortality. Twisted by centuries of pain and bitterness, Ardyn orchestrates the fall of Lucis, aiming to destroy the royal line and the gods themselves.
                
                Noctis learns that he is the Chosen King, prophesied to end the Starscourge but at the cost of his own life. After a decade lost within the Crystal, during which the world is consumed by darkness, he returns to a ravaged Eos. In a climactic battle, he defeats Ardyn in both physical and spiritual realms, then offers his life to the Astrals to purge the darkness once and for all.
