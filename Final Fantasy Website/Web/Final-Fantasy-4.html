        <div class="justified-text">
            <p>Final Fantasy IV centers around Cecil Harvey, the conflicted captain of the Red Wings, the elite airship fleet of the militaristic Kingdom of Baron. The story begins as Cecil starts questioning his king’s increasingly tyrannical orders—particularly the violent seizure of the world’s elemental crystals. After voicing his doubts, Cecil is demoted and sent on a mission to deliver a mysterious package to the nearby village of Mist, accompanied by his best friend Kain, a skilled dragoon. When the package destroys the village and kills innocents, Cecil is horrified and resolves to defy the king. He rescues a young summoner girl named Rydia, who becomes one of his first allies. As Cecil journeys across the world, he uncovers that the crystals are being systematically stolen by a powerful and enigmatic sorcerer named Golbez, who commands monsters and manipulates kingdoms to do his bidding.

                Cecil’s personal journey takes a major turn when he climbs Mount Ordeals and undergoes a spiritual trial, shedding his identity as a dark knight and becoming a Paladin, symbolizing his redemption and moral awakening. Alongside companions like Rosa (his love interest and a white mage), Kain (whose loyalty is tested as he falls under Golbez’s control), Tellah (a grieving old sage seeking vengeance), and Edge (a ninja prince), Cecil battles Golbez and his elemental archfiends across multiple continents, underground realms, and eventually, the moon. The truth is revealed that Golbez is being manipulated by Zemus, a Lunarian—a being from the moon—who seeks to awaken a sleeping race and dominate the Earth. In a dramatic twist, it’s revealed that Cecil and Golbez are brothers, both half-Lunarian, separated at birth by Zemus's manipulation.
                
                The game climaxes with Cecil and his party traveling to the moon itself to confront Zemus. After defeating him, Zemus transforms into Zeromus, the embodiment of hatred and destruction. With the help of their allies and the power of friendship and light, the party finally destroys Zeromus, bringing peace back to the world.
