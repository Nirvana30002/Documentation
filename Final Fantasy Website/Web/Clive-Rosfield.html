       Clive Rosfield is a richly developed and emotionally tormented protagonist whose journey in Final Fantasy XVI is a sweeping tale of vengeance, identity, and redemption set against the grim, war-torn backdrop of Valisthea. Born the eldest son of the noble Rosfield family of Rosaria, Clive is initially denied the birthright of becoming the Dominant of Phoenix, the Eikon of Fire, a role instead granted to his younger brother, Joshua. Yet despite this, Clive trains tirelessly and earns the title of First Shield of Rosaria, sworn to protect Joshua at all costs. This bond is shattered during a brutal ambush known as the Night of Flames, where Clive helplessly witnesses Joshua’s apparent death and encounters a mysterious second Eikon of Fire—Ifrit—unleashing a catastrophic power that changes Clive’s fate forever. Blaming himself and consumed by rage, Clive falls into the hands of the Imperial Army, eventually becoming a branded slave and an elite soldier in the shadows under the alias of "Wyvern." His path becomes one of violent revenge as he seeks the truth behind the identity of Ifrit and the manipulators of fate, especially the enigmatic entity Ultima, who seeks to reshape humanity in his image. Over time, Clive evolves from a vessel of rage into a protector of hope, forming deep bonds with a diverse cast, including the fierce Cidolfus Telamon, the healer and freedom-fighter Jill Warrick, and a ragtag group of revolutionaries determined to end the tyranny of the Mothercrystals—monoliths that fuel the magic but drain the land of life. As the Dominant of Ifrit, Clive is unique in that he eventually absorbs the powers of other Eikons—Titan, Garuda, Shiva, Ramuh, Bahamut, and Odin—transforming him into a godlike warrior capable of reshaping the very course of history. Yet his greatest strength is not his elemental power, but his unwavering compassion, moral integrity, and willingness to shoulder unbearable burdens so others may live free. Clive’s internal struggle—between man and myth, love and loss, vengeance and mercy—culminates in an unforgettable finale that questions what it truly means to be human in a world governed by gods and fate. He stands as one of the most mature, tragic, and heroic figures in Final Fantasy history: a flawed and noble soul who sacrifices everything not for glory, but for the chance at a better world.</p>
