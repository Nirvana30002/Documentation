        <div class="justified-text">
            <p>The story of Final Fantasy I begins in the world of Cornelia, where the once-glorious crystals that represent the four elements—Earth, Fire, Water, and Wind—have lost their power. As a result, the balance of the world has been disturbed. This is because the crystals were corrupted by four elemental fiends: Lich (Earth), Marilith (Fire), Kraken (Water), and Tiamat (Wind), who are under the control of an evil force known as Chaos.

            Four Warriors of Light, each carrying one of the corrupted crystals, are chosen by prophecy to restore balance and defeat the fiends. These Warriors are nameless and customizable, with players selecting their class (Fighter, Thief, Black Mage, White Mage, etc.) and names at the beginning of the game.
            
            The Warriors of Light journey across the world, battling the elemental fiends and their minions. Along the way, they uncover that the fiends are working to prevent the return of the Crystals’ power, and that Chaos has used them to disrupt the fabric of time itself.
            
            The story grows more complex as the Warriors travel through dungeons, explore cities, and gather clues about Chaos’s influence. They discover that Chaos, who was once a sorcerer in the past, had tried to take control of the world and was sealed away in the past, but his influence spread through time. The ultimate goal of the Warriors of Light is to enter The Temple of Fiends, a mysterious place, and defeat Chaos in order to restore peace and balance to the world.
            
            Gameplay-wise, Final Fantasy I is known for its traditional turn-based combat system, where players select commands for each character during battle, such as attacking, casting spells, using items, and defending. The game also features exploration, puzzle-solving, and random encounters, with each of the four classes bringing unique skills to the table.
            
            The game's narrative is driven by the theme of light versus darkness.</p>
