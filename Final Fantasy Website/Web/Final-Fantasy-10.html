                Final Fantasy X is a deeply emotional and richly layered story that follows Tidus, a talented and spirited blitzball player from the futuristic city of Zanarkand. His life is turned upside down when a colossal entity known as Sin attacks during a tournament, transporting him to the world of Spira, a land locked in a cycle of destruction caused by Sin's repeated appearances. There, Tidus meets the summoner Yuna, who is embarking on a sacred pilgrimage to defeat Sin by obtaining the Final Aeon—a ritual that requires her own life as sacrifice. Tidus joins her as a guardian, along with Wakka, a faithful and optimistic blitzball captain; Lulu, a stoic black mage; Kimahri, a protective Ronso warrior; Rikku, Yuna’s energetic Al Bhed cousin; and the mysterious Auron, a legendary guardian who once protected Tidus’s father Jecht—now revealed to be Sin himself.

As their journey unfolds across temples, ruins, and diverse cultures, the group not only confronts dangerous fiends and powerful enemies but also the harsh truths behind the teachings of the dominant religion, Yevon, which perpetuates the cycle of death through blind tradition and manipulation. They discover that Yuna’s pilgrimage is based on a false hope—the defeat of Sin is only temporary, and the summoner always dies, while Sin is reborn through the influence of Yu Yevon, a ghostly entity who uses the Aeons to maintain his existence.

Tidus, driven by love and a desire to protect Yuna from a fate he sees as cruel and pointless, challenges the status quo. Together, the group devises a way to defeat Sin permanently, rejecting the Final Aeon and choosing instead to destroy Yu Yevon directly. This bold decision leads to a climactic battle and the ultimate end of Sin, freeing Spira from its thousand-year cycle of suffering. However, with Sin's defeat, the dream of Zanarkand—an echo created by the Fayth—must vanish, and Tidus, being part of that dream, begins to fade. In a heartbreaking farewell, he and Yuna part as Spira begins its first steps into a new era, known as The Eternal Calm.
